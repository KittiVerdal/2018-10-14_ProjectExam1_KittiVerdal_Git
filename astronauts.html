          <div class="eventColumn">
          <p class="headerEvent answer">Astronauts and cosmonauts on the space station stay busy. There’s lots of work to operate
the many science experiments on board. The crew also has to make sure that the station is in top
shape, so they clean, check equipment, maintain and repair or replace broken equipment. Crew
members also must exercise two hours each day to stay fit and keep their bones and muscles
strong. Sometimes we need to do a spacewalk to work outside the station in our space suit. It’s a
tough and dangerous job but the view is terrific. The extra-vehicular activities, or EVAs, help keep
the space station running.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="eventColumn">
        <p class="headerEvent answer">The space station travels through space at 17,500 miles per hour at an altitude of about 220
miles. We orbit the Earth about once every 90 minutes. During the orbit of the Earth we are in
daylight for about 45 minutes and darkness for about 45 minutes. That means the sun will rise and
set 16 times a day. You can see the space station from where you live at certain times.</p>

      <div class="question">
      <h3 class="headerEvent questionHeader"> How long are the missions?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="eventColumn">
      <p class="headerEvent answer">The ISS missions, called expeditions, usually last about six months. There are three to six
crewmembers on board at all times. Professional astronaut crews come from the U.S., Russia,
Japan, Canada and Europe. NASA astronaut Mike Lopez-Alegria has flown the longest U.S. space
station mission to date, at 215 days. Valeri Polyakov, a Russian cosmonaut, spent 437 days in
space during one mission. A space shuttle crew is typically five to seven crewmembers. We have
carried as few as two and as many as eight at one time, and space shuttle missions have been as
short as two days and as long as 18 days.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-9 answerBottom">
    <div class="question">
    <h3 class="headerEvent questionHeader"> What does a launch feel like?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="eventColumn">
    <p class="headerEvent answer">In a Russian Soyuz capsule, which is how astronauts who are part of expedition missions get
to the space station, three people are crammed into a small space. The crew gets in the Soyuz
about two and a half hours before launch. Once the crew is all strapped in, they perform a series
of pre-flight checks of all the Soyuz systems. When the checks are finished, the crew waits while
workers on the launch pad do the final rocket preparations.</p>
<p class="headerEvent answer">Shortly before the time of launch you start hearing different noises below you and you know things
are getting ready to happen. Then, it is as if a giant beast is waking up. You hear and feel the
thumping and bumping of valves opening and closing as engine systems are pressurized. When
the first engines light there is a terrific low frequency rumbling and things start to shake. Then the
main engine lights and the rumbling and shaking get even louder. Slowly, slowly you begin to move
up and away from the launch pad. But, very quickly you build up speed and the g-load, or the force
of gravity or acceleration on a body, increases. You shake and rattle along and then there is a bang
when the rescue system is jettisoned, another bang when the four strap on boosters separate,
and another bang when the nose faring comes off. Now the windows are uncovered and you can
see light coming in. At the second stage separation there is another bang and the g-load drops
immediately. You go from about four and a half g’s down to about one and a half or two g’s. Then
the third stage engine lights; you have a big push forward and the g-load builds again.</p>
<p class="headerEvent answer">Eight and a half minutes after launch there is a loud bang and jerk and the last section of the rocket
is jettisoned from the Soyuz spacecraft. And just like that, you are there–in space. It feels like you
are hanging upside down in your shoulder harness. This is simply because there is nothing pushing
you back into your seat anymore. Everything floats, including you.</p>
<p class="headerEvent answer">In the space shuttle, astronauts are strapped in on their backs a few hours before launch. As the
main engines light, the whole vehicle rumbles and strains to lift off the launch pad. Seven seconds
after the main engines light, the solid rocket motors ignite and this feels like a huge kick from
behind. The vehicle shakes a lot and the ride is rough for the first two minutes as you are pressed
back into your seats with twice your weight. When the solid rocket motors burn out there is a
big flash of light as they separate from the big fuel tank the shuttle is strapped to. Then the ride
smoothes out. As you get higher into the thinning atmosphere and burn off most of the fuel, the
vehicle accelerates faster and you are pressed back into your seat with three times your weight for
the last two and a half minutes of the ride. This two and a half g’s feels like a giant gorilla is sitting
on your chest making it more difficult to breathe. Eight and a half total minutes after liftoff, the main
engines stop and immediately you go from the being squashed by the gorilla to being weightless</p>
<p class="headerEvent answer">Astronauts practice for launch frequently during training. We work in a simulator that mimics the
noise and shaking of launch, but cannot mimic the acceleration and speed of a real launch. We are
busy monitoring the shuttle systems during launch, but still have time to enjoy the feeling of going
from 0 miles per hour to 17,500 miles per hour in eight and a half minutes.</p>

  <div class="col-md-9 answerBottom">
  <div class="question">
  <h3 class="headerEvent questionHeader"> Where do you go in the Space Shuttle? Do you go to the moon?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="eventColumn">
  <p class="headerEvent answer">The Space Shuttle orbits the Earth at an altitude of 120-300 miles. We fly the shuttle to the
ISS where we dock and continue work onboard the station. In the past we have taken the shuttle to
the Russian MIR space station, and we have used it to visit the Hubble Space Telescope for on-orbit
repairs. Today, from our orbit above the Earth, we are in a good position to study the stars, study
the Earth, perform experiments, build and resupply the ISS, and learn how to live and work in the
absence of gravity.</p>
<p class="headerEvent answer">The shuttle is not designed to go to the moon. It has never carried enough fuel to get to the moon
and back, and, since there is no atmosphere on the moon, the wings would be of no use, and
the shuttle could not land. We last visited the moon with American astronauts during Apollo 17
in 1972. Currently, NASA is developing a new rocket and a new space craft that will take people
deep into space.</p>

<div class="col-md-9 answerBottom">
<div class="question">
<h3 class="headerEvent questionHeader"> How long do you have to train before you fly in space?</h3>
</div>
<div class="eventColumn">
<p class="headerEvent answer">Astronauts are in constant training for space flight. The initial training involves learning
about basic space station systems, space walking, and operating the robotic arm. You continue
this training while awaiting a mission assignment. Once assigned to a flight, specific training
for your mission may take as long as three years. The length of training depends on how
complicated the tasks are on your mission. ISS missions require that you speak Russian, which
adds time to your training.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="col-md-9 answerBottom">
<div class="question">
<h3 class="headerEvent questionHeader"> What effects does space flight have on your body?</h3>
</div>
<div class="eventColumn">
<p class="headerEvent answer">A ‘normal’ body will adapt to the ‘abnormal’ environment of space in many ways. Immediately
upon entering zero gravity, fluids in your legs and the lower part of your body move upwards
towards your head. In fact, your face will feel and look swollen. Except for the occasional headache
and congestion, astronauts aren’t bothered by this fluid shift. Some astronauts feel dizzy and have
an upset stomach during the first few days of a space flight as they get used to zero gravity. This
feeling usually goes away after three or four days. After a few days almost everyone is used to zero
gravity and feels great. If you don’t exercise, your bones and muscles will get weak. Upon return to
earth, you must get used to gravity again. Sometimes this makes you feel dizzy or queasy. If you
are returning from a two week flight, readjusting might take a day or two. If you are returning from
a six month flight, it may take several weeks to feel ‘normal’ again.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="col-md-9  answerBottom">
<div class="question">
<h3 class="headerEvent questionHeader"> What do you do when you aren’t on a mission?</h3>
</div>
<div class="eventColumn">
<p class="headerEvent answer">When astronauts are not flying on a mission or training for a mission, they support other
missions. There are many jobs on the ground required to support the design, preparation,
training and flying of a space mission. Astronauts work in mission control (the ‘voice’ that
communicates with astronauts in orbit), check out procedures and the checklists the crew in
space will use, help verify the space station and vehicle software, develop procedures and tools
to be used during spacewalks or robotic operations, help scientists in developing experiments
that will be run in space and perform other jobs in support of ISS and vehicle flights.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="col-md-9 answerBottom">
<div class="question">
<h3 class="headerEvent questionHeader"> What kind of food do you eat?</h3>
</div>
<div class="eventColumn">
<p class="headerEvent answer">We bring along several different types of food when we fly in space. Since we don’t have a
freezer, refrigerator, stove or microwave, most of the food has already been cooked, then freeze
dried and vacuum packed (meaning the water and air has been taken out of it), or it is thermally
stabilized (meaning treated and sealed in a package to prevent spoiling), much like camping
food. These packages of freeze dried food can be reconstituted by adding water and then
warmed up in a small warming oven.</p>
<p class="headerEvent answer">We don’t want food that makes crumbs in space since crumbs would float all over the place and
that could clog up equipment! Peanut butter, in fact, is the nearly perfect space food. It has no
crumbs and almost everyone loves peanut butter. We can bring fresh foods with us, as long as
we eat them early in the mission before they spoil.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="col-md-9 answerBottom">
<div class="question">
<h3 class="headerEvent questionHeader">How do you go to the bathroom in space?</h3>
</div>
<div class="eventColumn">
<p class="headerEvent answer">The space potty is a little different than the Earth potty. First of all, to keep from floating
away, you must use foot-loops or straps while ‘sitting’ on the seat. This holds you on to the
seat, sort of like a seat belt. Secondly, the space potty uses suction, not water, to «flush».</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="col-md-9 answerBottom">
<div class="question">
<h3 class="headerEvent questionHeader">Do you watch TV? What do you do for fun?</h3>
</div>
<div class="eventColumn">
<p class="headerEvent answer">The space station crews can ask mission control to send them shows that they can watch
during dinner or off-duty time. They can also watch movies on their laptops. They may bring
books, music, and musical instruments with them. Some astronauts enjoy hobbies, such as
drawing, photography, and HAM radio.</p>
<p class="headerEvent answer">During missions, astronauts are very busy. The few hours of free time may also be spent
looking out the window at the beautiful Earth below, listening to music, surfing the web, or
corresponding with friends and family back home.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="col-md-9 answerBottom">
<div class="question">
<h3 class="headerEvent  questionHeader">Are you scared to fly in space?</h3>
</div>
<div class="eventColumn">
<p class="headerEvent answer">A very experienced astronaut who has flown every space vehicle from Gemini to the shuttle
once said that if you are not just a little afraid, you don’t know what’s happening. Astronauts
are well aware of the risks involved in space travel. We are willing to take these risks because
we believe in the mission of space exploration and we think the risk is well worth the benefit.
Though these risks can make us nervous at times, when we are flying, we don’t let the
nervousness interfere with doing our jobs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="col-md-9 answerBottom">
<div class="question">
<h3 class="headerEvent questionHeader">What do you do if you get sick in space?</h3>
</div>
<div class="eventColumn">
<p class="headerEvent answer">We carry first aid kits and some special medical equipment into space with us. We also are
trained to take care of most minor and some major medical problems. There is not a doctor on
most flights, but all crewmembers are trained in basic first aid and CPR. We can talk to doctors
on the ground if we need help. If someone gets very sick in space, we can make an emergency
trip back to Earth.</p>

<div class="question">
<h3 class="headerEvent questionHeader">What should I study in school if I want to be an astronaut?</h3>
</div>
<div class="eventColumn answerBottom">
<p class="headerEvent answer">Astronauts come from many different backgrounds, all of them scientific or technical.
You may be interested in being a jet pilot and a test pilot, which may qualify you to be an
astronaut. In general, astronauts are scientists and engineers with a lot of education and broad
experience. Find something you like, study hard, and do your best in school. You will have more
choices in life if you always do your best.<br><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/about/index.html">To learn more about the education you need, read more here»</a></p>
